# Oxygen Not Included: Sight Not Included Plus

Original credit goes to Steam user @Vaca.

The Duplicants suffered some interferences during the teleportation and lost the ability to see all the way through walls.
Now they can only see as far as they can reach!

This mod only interferes with the range of sight when clearing the hidden fog.

Updated version of mod allows player to customize sight radius from original mod value up to original ONI game sight radius. There are five sight options available:
- Minimal (original SNI mod level)
- Small
- Medium (middle way through original and Minimal)
- Almost Original
- Original (original ONI game radius)
